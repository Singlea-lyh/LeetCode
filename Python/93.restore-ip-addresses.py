#
# Given a string s containing only digits. Return all possible valid IP
# addresses that can be obtained from s. You can return them in any order.
# 
# A valid IP address consists of exactly four integers, each integer is between
# 0 and 255, separated by single points and cannot have leading zeros. For
# example, "0.1.2.201" and "192.168.1.1" are valid IP addresses and
# "0.011.255.245", "192.168.1.312" and "192.168@1.1" are invalid IP
# addresses.Â 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# Input: s = "25525511135"
# Output: ["255.255.11.135","255.255.111.35"]
# Example 2:
# Input: s = "0000"
# Output: ["0.0.0.0"]
# Example 3:
# Input: s = "1111"
# Output: ["1.1.1.1"]
# Example 4:
# Input: s = "010010"
# Output: ["0.10.0.10","0.100.1.0"]
# Example 5:
# Input: s = "101023"
# Output: ["1.0.10.23","1.0.102.3","10.1.0.23","10.10.2.3","101.0.2.3"]
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 0 <= s.length <= 3000
# s consists of digits only.
